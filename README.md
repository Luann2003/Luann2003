### Recent Project

#### Form Management System with Angular

Check out my latest project where I built a form management system using Angular. This project features:

- **Dynamic Form Handling**: Add, edit, and manage user information with a reactive form.
- **Form Validation**: Error messages are displayed only after the form submission if any fields are invalid.
- **Local Storage Integration**: Data is saved and retrieved from `localStorage` for persistence across sessions.

Explore this project on my [GitHub repository](#) to see how Angular and TypeScript can be used to create interactive and dynamic web applications.
